## Grafana SiaB Dashboard

Dashboard made up by Docker Monitoring and Node Exporter dashboards.

To import it from the Grafana GUI, we must select the option “Import dashboard” at the right of the dashboard list. We can then paste the [Dashboard JSON](https://github.com/marcllena/grafana-SiaB-dashboard/blob/main/SiaB_Monitoring_Dashboard.json) that defines it layout and panels, including queries and settings.
